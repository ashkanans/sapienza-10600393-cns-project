This is the CNS Project for Application Level Security part of the course.

Instructions for the project is:

1) Choose one popular open-source web application/framework, e.g., WordPress, Joomla, Django, Flask, etc.

2) Look at the CVEs / bugs / vulnerabilities reported by the community for the application. E.g., Google it: "<application> CVE" to find a list of CVEs.

3) Select 1-2 vulnerabilities: they should be related to the topics of the course. Do not choose naive / shallow bugs. One vulnerability is enough if you pick something that is interesting to discuss. Write to me to let me know which vulnerabilities you would like to consider: I will check them and give you an OK/KO.

4) Write a report (max 10 pages) that:
- briefly describe the architecture of the web application / framework
- describe the type(s) of vulnerability that you have considered
- describe the vulnerabilities in detail
- describe how to exploit the vulnerabilities 
- describe how the vulnerabilities were patched by the community
- (needed only for getting max points) describe (and provide with the report) a docker environment that is able to reproduce the vulnerabilities
